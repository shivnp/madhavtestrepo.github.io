Machine learning (ML) and Physics complement each other. While Physics is rigorous and precise, ML is efficient for scaling up analysis and control to large data sizes.

In this project, we are developing ML methods for computational Physics, applied to lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) and condensed matter Physics. So far, we have developed efficient sampling methods to study large statistical systems such as the Gross Neveu (GN) model [1], scalar $$\phi^4$$ theory [2], XY model [4] and guage theory [3]. From Physics perspective, our methods are useful to study phase transitions and continuum limits. These methods can be applied to very large model sizes, where conventional Monte Carlo methods and even general ML methods fail. From ML perspective, our methods are useful for conditioning the generative ML methods, avoid the problem of mode-collapse and learning from small number of ground truth samples.
