- We have multiple openings for <span style="color:#cc0000">students interns</span> and <span style="color:#cc0000">short-term research assistants (after BTech)</span> to work with us on audio LLMs and diffusion models. More details <a href="2024_UGPs/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
- We have an opening for <span style="color:#cc0000">postdoc</span> on adaptation of regression models over graphs. Candidates with strong background in machine learning are welcome to apply.

### About
The Machine Analysis of Data for Human Audition and Visualization (MADHAV) Lab  is a research group in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://iitk.ac.in/ee) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in) set up and led by [Prof. Vipul Arora](https://vipular.github.io).

Our groupâ€™s research interests lie at the intersection of the theory and application of machine learning - with a focus on applications in Audio and Physics. Our group focuses in the following areas:

  - Human Machine Learning
      - Efficient data labeling
      - Data efficient learning and adaptation
  - Generative Machine learning
      - Normalizing flows, adversarial learning, diffusion models
      - Sampling methods: Monte Carlo, application in Physics (lattice QCD and statistical physics)
  - Audio signal processing
      - Audio LLMs: textless speech tokenization and fast search
      - Music analysis
      - Speech recognition
  - Other applications
      - Image generation
      - Sensor calibration
