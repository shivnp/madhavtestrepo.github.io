Arkaprava Biswas is an MS-R student at Madhav Lab, IITK. His work focuses on domain adaptation for various problems in audio. He has a B.Tech. degree from Kalyani Government Engineering College, West Bengal. In various real world audio classification problems labelled real audio is needed to build a state-of-the-art system. However it is very costly and time-consuming to label real audios. The work-around is to use synthetic or existing labelled audio datasets. But performance degrades when model trained on those kinds of datasets are deployed on real audio recordings. Arkaprava is working on effective domain adaptation techniques to solve this problem using those labelled datasets and vast amount of unlabeled real recordings. -->
