#### Guidelines
- SURGE applicants willing to work in lab should also refer to the details below.
- Duration 8-12 weeks (starting early-mid May). 
- It is your responsibility to present your progress in time (once a week).

#### How to apply
UGs/PGs willing to do projects with us in summer 2024 can apply for the following projects. 

Submit your details to the applicant interest form [here](https://forms.office.com/r/CTGv1cpM5F). The last date to fill the form is 27 January, 2023.

Shortlisted candidates shall recieve a short coding assignment, following which final selections will take place.
Well performing interns may also receive stipend.

## Projects

### Equation Builder (ML4Physics)
Use AI to analyse data to formulate equations that describe the data.

### Label Propagation
Develop methods to efficiently propagate labels from a small labelled set to a large unlabeled database. Can you make NNs learn sufficiently from a small set to populate raw examples with labels?

With growing scale of datasets this has immense potential, as manual labelling is both resource and labour-intensive.

<!-- ### Mistake Detection in Music Teaching
In Hindustani Classical Music teaching, a student learns various ornamentations (ex. Meend, Murki, Gamak) which are the building blocks of any Raga. In this project, we aim to detect the mistakes a student makes while learning and suggestions to improve. Potential challenges include- Efficient representation of ornamentations and lack of labelled data.

We have a small student-teacher dataset of music teaching acquired within lab.

### Music Audio Labeling
Label music audio with what instruments are playing, who is the singer, what raga is being performed, etc. using AI methods.

This project involves several tasks with the challenges including analyzing the underlying structure of the music data with limited supervision.

<!-- ### Raga Identification
A Raga in Hindustani Classical music represents the melodic structure which represents the mood of a music performance. It provides a melodic framework to the performers for improvisation and composition. 

The task of Raga Identification includes building machine learning models which can identify the structure to efficiently distinguish between various Ragas as a music expert would do. Potential challenges include effeciently separating acoustically similar Ragas from each other.

### Image Generation
Use generative machine learning to generate images. Control style by conditioning the models.
