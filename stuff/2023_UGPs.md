#### Guidelines
- No PVF without tangible progress. At least two semesters of work for LoR.
- It is your responsibility to present your progress in time (once a week).

#### How to apply
UGs willing to do projects with me (UGP or otherwise) can apply for the following projects. 
Send me an email with the heading "[UG Project Appl] \<Project Name\>".

<!-- NOTE: I have received a large number of requests for SURGE. I can accept your request if you can show me your progress on the problem you want to work on.
- Give me a detailed project proposal of what you will be doing. I have given you the problem (if not, take one of the following).
- If you are working with me already, give a presentation on your progress.
Mention if you have done an ML course with me before.
- I will accept your request only if you give a satisfactory presentation and proposal (2 pages). -->

<!-- ## Automatic Speech Recognition
Needs knowledge of machine learning and time series models taught in EE603A (MLSP). -->

<!-- ## Audio Analysis on Android
Needs knowledge of Android app development. It involves building a front end (on Android) for signal processing and machine learning tools (these tools will mostly run on a server). **Open for all, including junior undergrads**. Music knowledge is a plus. **Remote work** possible. You can also work on related machine learning problems side by side. -->

<!-- ## DCASE challenge
(http://dcase.community/challenge2021/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection)[http://dcase.community/challenge2021/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection] <br>
This is an annual international challenge on machine learning.
We are forming a team from IITK to participate for 2022. -->

<!-- ## Audio Representations
Learn discrete audio representations for fast audio search. Develop on our state-of-the-art technologies to index music and speech. Read either of the following:
- [Wav2Tok: Deep Sequence Tokenizer for Audio Retrieval, ICLR 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=v8Mi8KU6056)
- [Attention-based audio embeddings for query-by-example, ISMIR 2022](https://ismir2022program.ismir.net/poster_100.html)

## Audio Categorization
Learn deep representations to categorize audio based on different criteria such as speaker/singer, music genre and instruments. Read [Arora et al., ICASSP 2019](https://assets.amazon.science/9e/43/bf691fa0442ca94cefd3714ed4f6/deep-embeddings-for-rare-audio-event-detection-with-imbalanced-data.pdf). -->

## Projects

### Image Generation
Use generative machine learning to generate images. Control style by conditioning the models. Cash prizes if you are able to complete the task by October 2023.

### Automatic Speech Recognition
How does Alexa or Siri work? What are their limitations?
Can we make our own ASR models that overcome these limitations?
Students willing to work on these topics are welcome to apply for these sub-problems:
- Automatic Speech Recognition for Indian English
- Automatic Speech Recognition for Hindi Speech
Watch [CTC-1](https://youtu.be/-bHwy_SewJ4), [CTC-2](https://youtu.be/XM3MF1n28es) and [CTC-3](https://youtu.be/hU5qgefwLrM).

### Touch controlled music
Make flexible printed sensors to interact with musical instruments.

<!-- ### Music Catalogue (Wiki)
Create a wiki portal to organize/catalogue a large database of music. Each music recording has information about raga, singer, accompaniments, etc. This project involves designing the best way to organize the information for public use. -->


<!-- ## Audio Search
If you have a partial, possibly noisy, audio recording, can you find out the original audio file from a large database?

## Query by Humming
If you remember the tune of a song, can you search that song by humming the tune?

## Spoken Term Detection
If you wish to find certain terms spoken by someone, can you locate them in the audio files in a large database? -->

<!-- ## Models for Music Teaching
Involves working with our music teacher(s) to study learning behavior of students, and to make computational models of the same. You need to be **on campus** for this project. You can also work on machine learning aspects of it side by side. -->

<!-- ## Time Series Analysis for Air Quality Sensors
Building ML models for regression. Relevant papers: 
- Sonu Kumar Jha, Mohit Kumar, Vipul Arora, Sachchida Nand Tripathi, Vidyanand Motiram Motghare, and A. A. Shingare, “Domain adaptation based deep calibration of low-cost PM2.5 sensors”, IEEE Sensors Journal, 2021.
